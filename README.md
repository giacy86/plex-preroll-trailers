# Plex-Preroll-Trailers
Simple and rough set of python script that download trailers for the upcoming/now playing movies in theaters 
and show it as a preroll video before watch movies in Plex.

## Why
For having a theaters-like experience when watching movies in Plex at home.

## Requirements
The heart of the scripts is written in python, so they can work on all platform that have python installed. However there are 2 bash script for Linux/Ubuntu, but they are so simple that can be adapted for other OS.

 - Python
 - [tmdbsimple](https://github.com/celiao/tmdbsimple/blob/master/README.rst)
```
pip install tmdbsimple
```
 - TheMovieDB API key
 - [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md#installation)
```
sudo -H pip install --upgrade youtube-dl
```
 - FFmpeg
## How it works
The script ***download_preroll_trailers.py*** connect to TheMovieDB.org, select a user defined numbers of movies that, for your country, **are in theaters or are upcoming**, orders them by popularity and **download from YouTube** the **trailers** associated (retrieved from TheMovieDB API), write a JSON file with the filenames of the downloaded trailers.

The script ***mix_preroll_trailers.py*** load from the JSON file the filenames of the downloaded trailers, select randomly a user defined number of trailers to play within Plex and create a text file with the selected number of videos.

The script ***concat_preroll_trailers.sh***  takes the chosen videos from the text file and merge them with FFmpeg.

The script ***download_preroll_trailers.sh*** simply remove the old downloaded videos and execute the *download_preroll_trailers.py*.

## Settings
For custom settings edit directly the beginnings of the scripts.

## Usage
- *Clone* and *cd* to the repository directory
- ```sudo chmod +x *.sh```
- ``` crontab -e ``` for add the bash scripts to *CRON*. Personally i use: 
 ```0 3 * * fri path/to/download_preroll_trailers.sh``` once a week download trailers
```0 3 * * * /path/to/concat_preroll_trailers.sh``` once a day mix the trailers that will be played into Plex.
- Go to *Plex Settings > Server > Extras* click on the *Show Advanced* and into *"Cinema Trailers pre-roll video"* set */path/to/plex-preroll-trailers/preroll_trailers.mp4*
